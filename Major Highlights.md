You can upload this Macro either from the Control Hub (CH) or directly from the device.
If you have multiple floors, and each floor has its own CAD file (which is common), make sure to change the Widget ID for each floor.
Each floor must have a different **Widget ID.**

For example: If you have 3 floors and you want to see each floor separately on the navigator, you need 3 separate Macros. If you put all 3 Macros on the same navigator panel, each one must have a unique Widget ID.
